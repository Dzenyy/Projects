	     <p class="text">Traditional Bosnian food shares similarities with Turkish and Mediterranean cuisine, a legacy of 400 years of Ottoman rule. Typical dishes include organic meat, usually lamb or beef to meet Halal requirements, slow-cooked in their juices with a seasoning of spices. Meals tend to be light with a generous portion of vegetables.</br>Here are some of the dishes:</p>

	   <p class="txt"><strong>Cevapi</strong> are small, oblong-shaped kebabs from lamb and beef served in somun (Bosnian pita bread) with raw onions. Locals eat this for lunch, dinner, or as a snack. Chefs grill the meat and serve between five to ten individual kebabs on a plate with a sour cream sauce. Each restaurant cooks and seasons in a different way, making each cevapi slightly different. You can also find regional variances that use mutton or lamb.</p>

	   <p class="txt"><strong>Burek</strong> comes from Turkey brought to the Balkans by the Ottoman. Bureks have a flaky pastry with a meat, cheese, or spinach filling. Almost every bakery in the country sells this greasy snack, which is sometimes sold individually or by weight. Bosnians and tourists tend to have a love-hate relationship with it. On the one hand, a delicious and filling snack, on the other, they’re very greasy and full of fat.</p>

	  <p class="txt"><strong>Begova corba</strong> or Bey’s Soup in English, was an Ottoman favourite. Slow-cooked chicken and vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and celery, boil into a thick, creamy stew making a warm appetiser. Bey’s is often served with a sour cream or sauce in a clay bowl and locals cook and eat this soup especially during holidays and festivities.</p>

	  <p class="txt"><strong>Tufahija</strong></br>The Ottomans liked their sweet desserts and introduced Tufahija to Bosnia. An apple boiled in sugar and stuffed with walnuts is served with its syrup and whipped cream in a large glass. Super sweet Tufahija complements the strong, bitter taste of Bosnian coffee and locals tend to enjoy both at the same time.</p>

	  <p class="txt"><strong>Baklava</strong> found across the Balkans and Caucasus, is a dessert treat made from sheets of filo pastry. Bosnian Baklava looks a bit like a small cake with layers of nuts, syrup and honey. As the Ottomans expanded their Empire, they brought this favourite sweet, which has now evolved into Bosnia’s own. The high sugar content and sweet flavour make this a perfect side to go with your coffee.</p>
